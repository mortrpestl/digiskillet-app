# DigiSkillet - A Digital Skills App for All Ages

# About DigiSkillet
The Filipino people are constantly behind their Southeast-Asian peers with digital skills and literacy: we always rank at the bottom not just in Southeast Asia, but in the world when it comes to handling digital technology and being equipped with digital awareness. 

DigiSkillet aims to help change this problem by delivering easy-to-understand and intuitive tutorials to you. These tutorials fall under one of the five areas of digital skills and literacy that we identified, which are Data and Information Literacy, Communication and Collaboration, Digital Content Creation, Safety, and Problem-Solving.

Our application will display tutorials made either by the developers or contributors of the research to you. We have tweaked the elements of the application such as the buttons and pages to ensure a smooth and effective experience on your side. However, we still appreciate any feedback if you spot inconveniences while navigating the app.
