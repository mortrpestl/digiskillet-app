# DigiSkillet - A Digital Skills App for All Ages

# About DigiSkillet
The Filipino people are constantly behind their Southeast-Asian peers with digital skills and literacy: we always rank at the bottom not just in Southeast Asia, but in the world when it comes to handling digital technology and being equipped with digital awareness. 

DigiSkillet aims to help change this problem by delivering easy-to-understand and intuitive tutorials to you. These tutorials fall under one of the five areas of digital skills and literacy that we identified, which are Data and Information Literacy, Communication and Collaboration, Digital Content Creation, Safety, and Problem-Solving.

Our application will display tutorials made either by the developers or contributors of the research to you. We have tweaked the elements of the application such as the buttons and pages to ensure a smooth and effective experience on your side. However, we still appreciate any feedback if you spot inconveniences while navigating the app.

# The Creators
Justin Camacho, Skye Del Rosario, and Diogn Mortera are the members of the research group working together to bring a complete DigiSkillet to you. 

Justin Camacho is the member responsible for handling communications between parties to make sure that DigiSkillet is properly tested before being published to the public.

Skye Del Rosario handles the front-end portion of the project by managing the overall look and feel of DigiSkillet: the visual traits of the application can be attributed to his work.

Lastly, Diogn Mortera (me) is responsible for tweaking the visual elements created by Skye Del Rosario so that they display the correct information and data. He also handles the storage of information posted to DigiSkillet by working with a database.

# Example Tutorials

The tutorial curriculum is based on the 4th Sustainable Development Goal and the European Union's DigComp 2.1.
